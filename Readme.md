# Transparent Funding Platform

A decentralized funding platform built on Ethereum using smart contracts. This platform allows users to create projects, donate funds, and track project funding in a transparent way. Once a project's funding goal is reached and the deadline is over, the project owner can withdraw the funds.

## Features

- **Create Projects**: Users can create a project by specifying the project name, description, funding goal (in ETH), and funding duration (in seconds).
- **Donate to Projects**: Users can donate ETH to any project, helping it reach its funding goal.
- **Transparent Tracking**: View the funding status of any project, including the total funds raised, funding goal, and the remaining time until the deadline.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Project owners can withdraw the funds once the project has reached its funding goal and the deadline has passed.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum**: Decentralized blockchain platform for storing project data.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language to create the funding platform contract.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for Ethereum wallet and transaction management.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need the following:

- **MetaMask** browser extension installed.
- **Ethereum network**: Either use a testnet (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) for testing or the Ethereum mainnet.
- **Deployed Smart Contract**: A deployed instance of the `TransparentFundingPlatform` smart contract.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transparent-funding-platform.git
cd transparent-funding-platform
```
````

### 2. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the `TransparentFundingPlatform` contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile and deploy the smart contract using an Ethereum development framework like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
2. After deployment, copy the contract address and ABI.

### 3. Update Frontend with Contract Details

In the `index.html` file, replace the following placeholders:

- `const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";` – Replace with your deployed contract address.
- `const contractABI = [...]` – Replace with the ABI of your deployed contract.

### 4. Open the Application

Open the `index.html` file in your browser (make sure you have MetaMask installed and connected).

### 5. Interact with the Platform

- **Connect MetaMask**: Click "Connect MetaMask" to link your Ethereum account.
- **Create a Project**: Provide the project name, description, funding goal, and duration to create a new project.
- **Donate to a Project**: Enter the amount (in ETH) and the project ID to donate to a project.
- **Track Projects**: View all the projects, their funding status, and remaining time.
- **Withdraw Funds**: Once a project reaches its goal and the funding deadline is over, the project owner can withdraw the funds.

## How It Works

### Smart Contract Functions

1. **`createProject`**: Allows users to create a new project, specifying the name, description, funding goal, and duration.
2. **`donate`**: Users can donate ETH to a project before the funding deadline is reached.
3. **`withdrawFunds`**: Only the project owner can withdraw the funds after the goal is met and the funding period ends.
4. **`getProjectStatus`**: View the current status of a project, including its name, description, funding goal, total funds raised, remaining time, and whether the funding goal has been reached.

### Web3 Interaction

The frontend interacts with the smart contract via **Web3.js**:

- **MetaMask**: Acts as the Ethereum wallet to handle transactions and manage accounts.
- **Contract Methods**: The frontend calls the contract’s methods like `createProject`, `donate`, and `getProjectStatus` to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Disclaimer

This platform is for educational purposes only. Please thoroughly test the smart contract and frontend before deploying to the main Ethereum network. Always exercise caution when interacting with decentralized applications and blockchain-based systems.

### Instructions for the `README.md`:

- **Replace the placeholders**: Ensure that you replace the `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `contractABI` in the `index.html` file with your actual contract address and ABI.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: This README assumes that you have already deployed the contract. If not, you'll need to guide users through the deployment process using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
- **Testing**: You should test this app with a testnet (like Rinkeby or Goerli) to avoid real transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.

Let me know if you need further customizations or explanations!
